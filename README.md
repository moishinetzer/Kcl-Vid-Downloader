# Kcl Keats Video Downloader

A Video downloader using a selenium chrome headless driver.

Selenium must be downloaded and put in the same directory as the python file.

This was made due to the in-browser media player being really so bad.

After running on the keats main page, this will list which modules you take and ask you which one to select
followed by the week's content that you would like, and then will download and rename each video with the .srt
subtitle for that video as an m3u8 file.
Open this file using your favourite media player, mine, vlc
